# DOM Scraper - A Simple Chrome Extension

After **Email Previews** are generated in Litmus, clicking the `Copy Previews` button will place generated `html` markup to the clipboard, which contains the _title of the email_, and the _url to the full sized preview image_, along with alt text and a formatted class.

Example:
```

<div class="class-ol-office-365-dark">
  <h2>OL Office 365 Dark (macOS 10.15)</h2>
    <img src="https://ol..6.png" alt="OL Office 365 Dark">
</div>

```

> Download, unpack, enjoy!
